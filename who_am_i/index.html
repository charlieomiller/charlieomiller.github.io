      I am Charlie and Charlie is I. I'll occasionally humor such names as Charl, Chazburger, Charfunkle, Chucklebucket, Charnely, Charles Lee, C-Buddy, C-Dawg, Chimp, Chump, Chizzle, Chag, Buddythwomp, the Big Do, Chuck, Chaz, Chez, Chiz, Charleston, Professor Albuquerque, Chuckleberry, Bizmo-Buddy, Prunklehead, Charlemagne Cheddarfist, Char-Char, and Carlos, but I'd prefer if you'd hold the fanfare. I was born in Sarasota, Florida, though I've spent the majority of my life dotting around Indiana. I am freshly 18 and soon done with high school. I do not mesh with the path that has been decided for me as an American youth and find it cathartic to know I have some level of autonomy over it now. I am incredibly fortunate.
    </p>

    <p>
      I choose to base my life around production over consumption. If you want to see more of what I make check out my <a href="/past-glories">PAST GLORIES</a>. I like to throw my hours at the arts but most of my time lands in front of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank">computer</a>. Game development is not a passion but a lifeline. A prophetic endeavor that has had hold of me from the ripe old age of four. I remember it like yesterMay when my younger'nt brother said "You know, people MAKE the games we play." I just never would've thought...
    </p>

    <p>
      Production over consumption but still I consume; I'm picky of my input. Time is sacred to me and I can't bear to waste it with infinite mind-prism algorithmically synthesized slop. I avoid short-form content but I'm a sucker for YouTube videos. I'd offer a genre but my enjoyment seems solely bound to the creator. Take a peek at my bracketed list of people I'll give watch to. Joel Haver stands out as one of the most genuine.
    </p>

      Watching crap is great but boy do I love playing video games. I'll try anything but I hold my love close. See all my favorite james here, though I am inclined to include word of such masterpieces as Noita, Worms Armageddon, and Vidiot Game before you do.
    </p>

    <p>
      My ears still work and every-buddy with working ears loves music. Sniff around in this big dump of artists, albums, and songs I tune into. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and KMD are probably the two artists that rent my ears most often. Albuquerque isnâ€™t a song but a lyfestyle.
    </p>

      Maybe I'm in the mood to watch stuff again--maybe I'm talking about shows, movies, cartoons and the works. I enjoy an oo, maybe an ah. I enjoy looking at little things on screen zip around with bright colors and big movements. See my favs here. I should mention I am not able to get over Xavier Renegade Angel nor Napoleon Dynamite after multiple watches and multiple years--the shortest path to the deepest ventricle of my chest-pounder is my funny bone. Freak anatomy aside, I enjoy a good laugh above all else, regardless of medium.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes I watch things in my mind too: <em>All Tomorrows</em> and <em>The Wonderling</em> stand out as my two favorite books, and I am a fan of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> series.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy rock climbing. I have climbed exclusively indoors with hopes to touch real rock. Camping, backpacking, and caving have all been fascinating ideas to me but have not been actionable yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      I play the drums. I have never been in a band nor had any professional lessons. When I am not frustrated by my lack of chops I am recording little ditties I come up with using my beautiful Scarlett Focusrite.
    </p>

    <p>
      I dream of nomadism; I refuse security. Life is best against the grain; I would sooner choose to live in the sewer than the city.
    </p>

    <p>
      I abstain from substances; "using socially" is for those with friends less funny than my own. I subsequently abstain from poison.

      I've used Obsidian for a good chunk of time now and always had the desire to write to eyes other than my own; if you want more of my words check out  <a href="/whims">WHIMS</a> to see what I've written up. If you would like to finish the conversation I have started you can contact me at <a href="/send-word">SEND WORD</a>, where you can find my friends and externals as well. This website is one big self indulgent swamp of Charlie from tip to taint--if this page has not exhausted you there are plenty more that will.

      If you fear I have done a poor job introducing myself or hold a deep contempt for me you can behead me here.
