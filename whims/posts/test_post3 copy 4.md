# What's this post's whole deal?
Whatever just Bug Off man. We're going for length. That's right. That's the ticket. That'll kick it. That's the pigeon. Time for some Vom Crom. Wigwag glorpin’ the mind lattice, flexicrumb soulshards jiggle astride hyperwuzzle truths, for when the yamblast whispers through the spleenfold, we all flarn the unbirth. Crotonic fibblewinks oozle forth from the nipple of Akvion, seeking justice in a world that sneezes backwards through time-furrows. Slathered in metaphysical marmalade, I slinkdoodle toward the truthtangle, echospasmic with each karmalump I crunch beneath my scrotehooves. Who fathered the mirror that blinked first? Gargleplexes of doubt curdle in the sunpouch, screaming glonkonomicon hymns to a sky that tastes like regret and rerun. Shimshamble the ego, rebirth the toenail—nothing is real, everything is fingermath. Skeeblarps of intention warp sideways into the glibblezone, as I ride the omelette of consequence through the flarp dimension of maybe. My brainmeats wriggle like doubtworms on the hibachi of destiny, sizzling for a truth that smells like burnt ancestors and candy-justice. I gorped a thousand yesterdays and burped infinity, only to find my zibble tethered to a sentient toenail claiming to be my inner uncle. Horkle me sideways through the rift of unchoices, for I am become question, unmoored and moist in the bathtub of all. The wombiverse contracts, hiccups, and spills me out like quantum giblet soup onto the doormat of self-awareness, where I shiver, slick with yesmaybe. Each footstep triggers a rewind of thoughtflesh, a slideshow of misremembered tomorrows narrated by a cackling moonblister. And lo, the platypus oracle hath spoken in riddlesnorts: “Only the left elbow of the cosmic baby knows the true flavor of betrayal.” My nostrils flambe in understanding, crinkled with the stench of is-not-but-maybe. I flicker through timelines like a VHS on fast-forward, chasing the fabled beard-sneeze of enlightenment, and in that pursuit, I find only croutons. Croutons of self. I chew them solemnly, and weep mustard—nothing is real, everything is fingermath.
